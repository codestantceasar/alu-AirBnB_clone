# # AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This project is the first step in building a full web application similar to AirBnB. It involves creating a command-line interpreter that can manage objects, including creating, updating, destroying, and persisting them to a file.

The console works like a simple shell and interacts with a storage engine to persist Python class instances (like User, Place, Review, etc.) to a JSON file.
